>bicycle-sharing systems is been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent the bicycles as long as the users needs it.Bicycle-sharing systems have deployes new technologies like gps to track the distance,time etc.It is easy for a user to access a lock within the system to unlock or return bicycles.
In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on FordGoBike 2017 data.

**Summary of Findings:**
--
>According to the dataset there are 90.3% subscriber where 24.4% are customers. fro the user the calculation of genders are  76.9% of Male customers,21.8% of female Customers and others customers are 1.4%. but the usage according usage of month wise the subcriber usage is more than the customers.most of the genders are subcribers.comparing the usage of bike between customer uses the bike more in the weekends and subscriber uses bike more in the weekdays.the usage timings in weedays are between 9 Am to 5 Pm and in weekends the usage of bike are between 11 Am to 5 Pm.male rides more bikes that female riders.there are diffrent timimgs for weekdays and weekends.Customers have ride the bike for a maximum distance than Subscribers.


**Keyinsights for the presentation:**
--
>i have used more countplot for both univariate and bivariate plotting.using countplot it is easy to watch the datas for the gender count and user count in unviarate plotting.
>the use of countplot in bivariate was to was to campare one variable with another variable.
>barplot and violin plot was used in bivariate plotting to find the age difference in genders and users.
>barplot was also used for comparing two variables like the count of usage of bike ride from the genders for a week,month and year.it was not complicated to visualize in box plot as it provides 5 number variables.
>pointplot was used to compare the rides according to the month for both users and genders.
>finally the heatmaps and pairplot. the heatmaps was bit complicated to find the values as it uses the whole numerical columns from the dataset.
>pairplot was used for duration,distance and age columns for both genders and users.
